## Defining the problem
We are given a regression problem with a dataframe consisting in `d` features `X_1, X_2, ..., X_d` and `n` observations.  Each feature corresponds to a 1D-signal  (e.g. a time-series): the i-th observation is the value at a certain time `t_i` of the `d` signals.

Thus, the dataframe is a `n x d` matrix with coefficient `(i,j)` given by `X_j(t_i)` for `i=1,...,d` and `j=1,...,n`.

We are interested in predicting the variable `y` which depends on the values of the 1D-signals `X_1, X_2, ..., X_d`. Namely, we suppose that `y = f(X_1, ..., X_d)`. Note that we do not suppose `y` to be an explicit function of the time.

Suppose that `n` is small (**small-data problem**). We try to answer the following questions:

*Does the time-signal nature of the features gives us more information than the sole observations `X_j(t_i)`?*

*Is it possible to infer new data and augment the dataset size? Is this helping in predicting `y` (e.g., reducing overfitting)?*



### experimental method
For the sake of analysis, we consider a dataframe `data_A` with `N` observations where `N>>n`. It is split in `train_A` and `test_A`. We mainly focus on classical (uniform) random sampling and on random block sampling (random blocks of consecutive observations), depending on the dataset.

#### sampling procedure
Through a **sampling procedure** on `train_A`, we derive a smaller dataframe called `train_B`; similarly we obtain `test_B` from `test_A`. The two dataframes `train_B` and `test_B` form `data_B`: the small dataframe with `n` observations. We refer to the Documentation section for the sampling procedure.

#### data augmentation
From `train_B`, we perform **data augmentation** to dispose of a larger number of observations and obtain a bigger dataframe called `data_C`, the dimension of `data_C` is up to 8 times the one of `train_B`. The **synthetic features** and labels are inferred using different techniques, we refer to the data augmentation section in the report.

#### evaluation with RMSE and R2 score
A same machine-learning algorithm is then trained on the different `train_X` splits, where `X = A, B` or `C`: this yields the three models `model_A`, `model_B` and `model_C`. We evaluate each model on `test_A` (and `test_B`) to understand whether the imputation technique is improving the stability and/or the score of `model_C` with respect to `model_B`. The metrics under consideration are given by the (root) mean square error and the R2 score.

### dataset examples
We focus on the following open repository available at UCI: [Appliances energy prediction Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Appliances+energy+prediction)


## Current module version
To work with our functions, just download the `tsmall` directory and launch python in the same root directory of `tsmall`. It then suffices to type `from tsmall import *` to retrieve all the functionalities.

Here a list of the relevant notebooks present in the repository:
- `quantile_based_augmentation.ipynb` : test quantile-based augmentation developed during this week
- `DL_aug.ipynb` : test data augmentation using LSTM-VAE
- `signal_distortion.ipynb` : contains information about fourier and wavelet discrete transform, it uses the submodule `tsmall.augment`.


Architecture of `tsmall` module:
```
tsmall/
    augment.py          # contain signal_distortion, dfaug and mdfaug
    dl_method.py        # function for LSTM-VAE
    preprocessing.py    # contain block_sampling and min_max_normalization
utils.py                # useful function used in the notebooks
```

#### dependencies
If you have `pipenv` installed, the environment is set in the `Pipfile`. You can load it by simply executing `pipenv install` inside the git repository.

Otherwise, you need the following libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn` and `pywt` (wavelet pkg) for running quantile-based augmentation; if you want to test DL methods, you need `keras` and `tensorflow < 2` (code is running on `python 3.7`). The notebooks require `matplotlib`.

### last updates

## Documentation
We refer to the [report](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03211100) available on Hal.

### bibliography
See the [report](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03211100) on Hal for related research papers.

 Observe that most of the cited bibliography is focused on classification problems for NN algorithms. In such framework, the time-series is seen as an input and the augmentation technique allows to generate *synthetic time-series* on which the model can be trained. For these reasons, many of the aforementioned strategies are not suitable for our framework; however a few ideas (e.g. frequency domain transform, decomposition methods, etc.) could be developed and put into practice for standard ML algorithms.

 Python libraries:
 - `tsaug` is useful to modify time-series in the time space, but not necessarily for our scope | see the [documentation](https://signal_distortion.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
 - `sigment` data augmentation for audio signals | see the [documentation](https://notes.eonu.net/docs/sigment/0.1.1/index.html)

### data augmentation
Data augmentation is the process of generating artificial data in order to reduce the variance of the predictor and thus avoiding overfitting.

Within our framework, we can try to exploit the time-signal nature of the observations and to infer new values. Depending on the hypothesis one takes on `y`, different techniques are available:
 - Under stationarity assumptions one can use classical bootstrap techniques or model-methods (ARIMA, ARCH, etc.).
 - Under continuity assumptions of the signals, one can use interpolation techniques (however this seems not to substantially improve the results).
 - Fourier/wavelet transform, see next subsection
 - Quantile-based augmentation in feature space (related to data augmentation in classification problems): group observations by `y`-labels + transformation in feature-space

 Since we do not want to assume any additional hypothesis on `y`, we exclude the first two possibilities and focus on the last twos. It turns out that quantile-based augmentation works pretty well with k-NN. We also test LSTM-Variational Autoencoder.
