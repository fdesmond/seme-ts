## TO DO
- julien: test bejing dataset
- yiye: ??
- fabio: ??


To discuss:
- implement categorical data augmentation in augment.py
- why the method is not performing well on decision trees?
- understanding fine tuning in Fourier/Wavelet decomposition
- is signal normalization useful? (it seems not from energy dataframe) It seems not to improve the results.
